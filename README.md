this is the project of software engineering course in UQU , 2022 fall.

the software will provide the personal assistant the ability to handle so many things of his/her job only from one place without the distraction among different softwares or even doing the task manually in the real life. 
since we will give the service of registering appointments,booking halls for the meetings,deal with the emails in one application and the service of uploading files to archive them rather than doing it in old fashion way such as print the papers and then archive them in some folders. here is much easier and much saver over the time because it will be saved in our databases.

### <ins> it is just a documentation of the application idea and it is illustrate the steps for developing the application in documented way.
maybe we will see it in the near future :) .
